# FLAIRS-26
Code and experiments for Explainable Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks for structured decision modeling, evaluated on the Rossmann sales benchmark with hierarchical and graph-based baselines.

Both a Jupyter notebook and a Python script are provided for explainability:
- `run_explainability.ipynb` enables interactive reproduction of results.
- `explainability_ig.py` contains the core implementation used by the notebook.
